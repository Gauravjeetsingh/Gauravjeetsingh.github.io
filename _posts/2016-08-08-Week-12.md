<p>I finished with the private/public model functionality. Tweaked the queries at profile page and news feed. Commited the code, and came to a serious problem of no access to server once again.</p>
<p>As I told the cpu usage was way too high, and I suspect it to be the reason for no connection. I rebuild the server again.</p>
<p>I had lost all hopes to deploy the freeBSD on server. But then I gave one more try. I started from the very beginning. I searched "deploying meteor app on freeBSD server." And a github link came across me, and it was how to deploy meteor app on a freeBSD digital ocean droplet.</p>
<p>It was exactly what I needed. However in the tutorial there was no mention of installing meteor, as per this tutorial it used meteor build to deploy the app onto server using node and npm. It sure seemed a practical and feasible approach.</p>
<p>I started following <a href="https://github.com/orangecms/freebsd-meteor-tutorial">this</a> tutorial.</p>
