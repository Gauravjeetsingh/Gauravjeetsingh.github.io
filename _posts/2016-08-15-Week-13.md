<h3>August 15</h3>
<div>
<p>Today I finished with the front end of dialog box of model viewer. Also I created a separate template named <code>modelEditor</code> for edit page as it was getting difficult to manage within model viewer template.</p>
<p>Today's commit consisted of this dialog box and copy to clipboard embed code.</p>
<p>I also started working on showing preview on the edit page itself to see how it looks like.</p>
<p>Another thing I worked today was finding ways to get that dialog box I created working, for show/hide I did the database thing, added an attribute show that toggles to true or false on clicking. But the part of model is still loaded in the render window. I need to refresh to see the change this is not what I want. Saw three js documentation there's a remove and visible function to do the required function. But for that I need to work on the very specific object whose name is clicked in the dialog box. Need to get that link. After that everything would work perfect</p>
<p>For changing color, it's real easy we have to specify the color in OBJMaterial object being used. Color is not specified as a string, it is specified as an object of THREE.color. this takes hexadecimal color code for instance 0xffffff</p>
<p>HTML input type color gives value as <code>#ffffff</code> and I need it in form of <code>0xffffff</code>. Traversed through OGV code and came to know there's already a function named <code>handleColorChange()</code> to deal with this. Yayy! </p>
