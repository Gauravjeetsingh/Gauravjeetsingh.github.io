title: Week 1 (code cleanup)
---

<p class="lead">
So it finally starts, today commence the first day of GSoC coding period. In this week as per my plan, I'd be doing a bit of code cleanup. This involves managing github repository, removing redundant code, making sure all the variable names are consistent and so on.

<p>God blessed with an amazing weather to commence this coding period. Such a relief from scorching days. Also, today I finished with my university exams and thus ready to code. This week's milestone is to clean the existing code. To finish what's already started seems a right approach. </p>
<p>After this cleanup, my next milestone is to successfully deploy the cleaned version of OGV.</p>
<p>Regarding work, I reviewed basic code, fetched all the branhes on my local machine, and started analysing what's in each branch, the suggested branch to work upon is gsoc2015-merged. I am trying to find if there's any line of code we need from some other branch. I am thinking to create github branch structure somewhat similar to given below:
<ul>
<li> Master (containing stable code)</li>
<li> Released (containing code of latest release)</li>
<li> dev (containing unstable under development code) </li>
</ul>
</p>
