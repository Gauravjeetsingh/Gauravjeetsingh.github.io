title: Week 6
---

<p class="lead">
Well, as per my proposal this week was supposed to be before mid term, but Mid term arrived a week early, and I wasn't able to do the stuff before mid term. The big highlight of this week's work is thumbnail generation. To automatically captured rendered view of uploaded model, and use it as a thumbnail in model feed. But there are some previous week's unfinished buisness, so after clearing them out, I will be onto thumbnail generation.

<p>Today I worked on deploying OGV app on the newly meteor installed server.</p>
<p>Started with using meteor up (mup) package, which is famously used to deploy meteor apps to debian based servers. I have used this with some other project so thought of giving it a try with freeBSD system. After several tries, and searches I realized that I can not use mup to deploy a meteor app on a freeBSD server</p>
<p>Another meteor package, named <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2-meteor">pm2-meteor</a> declared that they are capable of deploying app on ubuntu and freeBSD hosts. From documentation it seemed easier to use. Tried using it, couldn't get the configuration right, I kept getting an error with configuration syntax. After spending some time indulging with it, I thought to save it for future, let's try some another method of deployment.</p>
<p>While I was clearing my pm2 configurations, it came to my mind, that I haven't installed BRL-CAD on my server. Without BRL-CAD installed, OGV won't work. So I thought of doing it the first day in next morning.</p>

<p>Today I got access to a freeBSD digital ocean droplet. I was able to install meteor on it. I posted the steps in a separate <a href="http://gauravjeetsingh.github.io/2016/06/29/installing-meteor-freebsd.html">post</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the day was spent in doing this. It was my first time with freeBSD system. So it was hard to get started. I kept using ubuntu commands :P by habbit.</p>
<p>By the end of day I also worked on search redesign, it's almost complete now. Also there are lot of pending commits in my fork, will be sending pull request soon.</p>

<p>Started working on understanding search that is already implemented in OGV. OGV uses a meteor package and create a <code>searchSource</code> object, this makes searching easier by automatic handling of search history, browser cache.</p>
<p>Understood the existing part and started working on redesign of Search, the new design looks very similar to what proposed in proposal. I was able to get the same stuff done, without tweaking the backend. Thus I would improve search efficiency after improving search design.</p>
