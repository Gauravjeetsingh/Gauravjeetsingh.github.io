<p class="lead">I am happy to share that I got selected in GSoC 16. I will be coding my summer with <a href="http://brlcad.org">BRL-CAD</a> community. I will be working on Online Geometry Viewer, a 3D viewer written in Meteor.</p>

From [the project's abstract](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4756339498680320):

> OGV has the ambition to become something of an Instagram for 3D models. It includes features like profiles, likes, comments, followers. But the code is a lot buggy and unstable.

It's an immensely useful tool. Find out more by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor).
