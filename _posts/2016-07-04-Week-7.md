title: Week 7
---

<p class="lead">
This week I had to improve efficiency of handling obj files. There were two main tasks, one was to remove the temporary obj files created using conversion to free space on server. Another task was to merge the obj files, and load them as one entity to decrease the number of http requests. About 100 requests are made to render a simple model. This slow things down.

<p>I started working on thumbnail preview of model. As stated in my proposal, one way to take screenshot of model was to enable <code>preserveDrawingBuffer: true</code> and take screenshot using <code>renderer.domElement.toDataURL( 'image/png' )</code></p>
<p>Added the button to model view, clicking on it, stores the image data in collection <code>ModelFiles</code> as screenshot.</p>
<p>Also tried to solve the error, getting on freeBSD server, but no success. </p>
